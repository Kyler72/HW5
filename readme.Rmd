# Homicide Mapping in Denver, Colorado

This assignment visualizes homicide patterns in Denver, Colorado using the Washington Post homicide data.  

I created an `sf` map showing homicide locations, faceted by solved status and colored by victim race group.

## Tasks Completed

- Filtered the dataset to include only homicides that occurred in Denver, CO.
- Converted homicide locations into an `sf` object for spatial data visualization.
- Downloaded census tract boundaries for Denver using the `tigris` package.
- Created a variable indicating whether each homicide was Solved ("Closed by arrest") or Unsolved ("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest").
- Grouped victim race into the top three most frequent categories, lumping all others into "Other".
- Produced a faceted map using `ggplot2` showing:
  - Sub-city geography (tracts)
  - Homicide locations as points
  - Facets for Solved vs Unsolved
  - Colors representing victim race (top 3 categories)
